    <h2>First space mission</h2>
      <p> first space mission began on 19 November 1997, 
        as part of the six-astronaut crew that flew the Space Shuttle Columbia flight STS-87. 
        Chawla was the first Indian woman to go in space. She spoke the following words while traveling in the weightlessness of space, "You are just your intelligence.
        " She had traveled 10.67 million km, as many as 252 times around the Earth.
         On her first mission, Chawla traveled 10.4/6.5 million miles in 252 orbits of the earth, logging more than 376 hours (15 days and 16 hours) in space.[18][7] During STS-87, she was responsible for deploying the Spartan Satellite which malfunctioned, necessitating a spacewalk by Winston Scott and Takao Doi to capture the satellite. 
         A five-month NASA investigation exonerated [19] Chawla by identifying errors in software interfaces[20] and the defined procedures of the flight crew and ground control. After the completion of STS-87 post-flight activities, Chawla was assigned to technical positions in the astronaut office to work on the space station.
